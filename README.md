arduino-rover5--bluetooth_shield
================================

This code is a simple demo of controlling a Dagu Rover 5 with an Arduino UNO and a Seeedstudio Bluetooth Shield. The code is heavily commented and should be easy to follow. Code can be easily adjusted to use just 2 (instead of 4) motors, or to use with a USB serial interface (instead of bluetooth serial).

All that is required is to upload the .ino file to the arduino.
